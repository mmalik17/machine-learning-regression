# Project Overview: Predict House Price in Delhi NCR with Machine Learning
This project has a purpose to create machine learning model that can predict the house price in New Delhi.

# <b> Requirement for running the code </b>
Library needed to be installed:
Data analysis and visualization: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyplot
Machine Learning: sklearn

# <b> 1. Business Understanding </b>
## Background Problems
For the people that want to buy the house, sometimes it is difficult to identify whether the house price is normal or overvalued. The bunch of features (bedroom, bathroom, location, etc) in each house could make it more difficult to compare the prices between the house
## Purpose
With this machine learning model, comparing the prices between the houses will be easier and more automated 

# <b> 2. Data Preparation </b>
1. Data Cleansing
  - Removing the column that not related
  - Check missing value and handle it
  - Check data type
  - Check value of every column to see whether the value is make sense or not
2. Feature Engineering
Extract the city value from address feature  
3. Outlier removal
  - Outlier removal with business logic
  - Outlier removal with mean and standar deviation
4. One Hot Encoding for categorical column

# <b> 3. Machine Learning Modelling </b>

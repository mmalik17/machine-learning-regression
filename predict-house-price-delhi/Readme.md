# Predict House Price in Delhi NCR with Machine Learning

# <b> Requirement for running the code </b>
Library needed to be installed:
Data analysis and visualization: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyplot
Machine Learning: sklearn

# <b> 1. Business Understanding </b>
## Background Problems
For the people that want to buy the house, sometimes it is difficult to identify whether the house price is normal or overvalued. The bunch of features (bedroom, bathroom, location, etc) in each house could make it more difficult to compare the prices between the house
## Purpose
This project has a purpose to predict house price in New Delhi with machine learning. With this machine learning model, comparing the prices between the houses will be easier and more automated

## Action Items  


This project has a purpose to predict house price in New Delhi with machine learning. Before applying to machine learning, I perform data preparation by:
- removing the column that not related
- Feature Engineering
- Outlier removal
- One Hot Encoding for categorical column
